# TheMessengerRandomizerModAP
---

This project is based on the work from minous27 and is forked from [TheMessengerRandomizerMod](https://github.com/minous27/TheMessengerRandomizerMod).
This is a randomizer mod for the video game, *The Messenger*. It randomizes the items that can be found in the game
amongst each other as well as with other players' items by utilizing network connections in a multiworld setting, by
using the [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) architecture.

## Changes

* The player starts in Tower of Time HQ in the second quest state, but with none of the movement items they would
normally have at this point in the game except the climbing claws.
* You can return to Tower of Time HQ at any point by selecting the button from the options menu.
* A toggle windmill shuriken button is added to the menu after receiving the item. 
* Dialog in the game is modified to reveal what items were found instead of the normal conversations.
* The shop will show you what item you will be purchasing instead of the normal item.
  * This does not currently work for the figurines. 

## Randomizables

* Item upgrades that are normally obtained as part of the first quest
* Shop upgrades, Money Wrench, and Figurines
* Music Box notes
* Power Seals
* Phobekins
* Mega Time Shards
* Bosses now grant items on defeat
* Tower of Time HQ Portal destinations
* Level transitions

## How to use
Installation instructions, as well as steps for playing can be found on the [Archipelago website's game setup page](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/The%20Messenger/setup/en).
